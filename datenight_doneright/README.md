My project is called Date Night, Done Right and it allows users to select a random date night based off answering a few questions.

They can choose from going "out" or "in".

If they choose in they have the choice of a "movie night" or something else.

If they choose a "movie night" they are given the choice of what genre they would like to select. Based off the genre they choose the site randomizes from an array of API URLs to display all the information about the movie which was selected. 

I used HTML / CSS / Javascript / JQuery /Ajax to complete this project. 

The complex user interface module I used is a modal, I created 3 modals within the project. 

The live link to my site is: https://aegeanthompson.github.io/datenight_doneright/index.html#

I will be adding in the options/layout for "out" and "something else" at a later time. 

In the future I will pull from an API that allows you to pull all movie results from a given year, genre, etc. The OMDB API pull has to include a title or ID to a specific movie, so I wasn't able to use it in that way. 

I'd like to do the same for the recipes section by adding a Recipe API.
